    A bolt for fine-tuning Hugging Face models on commonsense reasoning tasks.

    This bolt extends the HuggingFaceBatchFineTuner to handle the specifics of commonsense reasoning tasks,
    such as the specific format of the datasets and the specific metrics for evaluation.

    The dataset should be in the following format:
    - Each example is a dictionary with the following keys:
        - 'premise': a string representing the premise.
        - 'hypothesis': a string representing the hypothesis.
        - 'label': an integer representing the label (0 for entailment, 1 for neutral, 2 for contradiction).
